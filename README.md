# CSC122-final-project

I've uploaded the stockWatcher folder which contains the stockWatcher.py, stockPriceLog.txt, and an PowerPoint presentation stockWatcher.pptx.
I've completed the code needed for step A and B,in the python file, and the corresponding context in stockWatcher.pptx.
Please continue to work on step C and complete stockWatcher.pptx.
Just edit the stockWatcher.py following the instruction. No work is needed for stockPriceLog.txt, which will be generated automatically when the program runs.
